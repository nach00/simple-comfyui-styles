I simply combined the two for use in ComfyUI. I also had to edit the styles.csv file to remove some incompatible characters (mostly accents). I also created the workflow based on Olivio's video, and replaced the positive and negative nodes with the new styles node. This workflow uses SDXL 1.0 Refiner for very quick image generation. 

styles.csv MUST go in the root folder (ComfyUI_windows_portable)

There is also another workflow called "3xUpscale" that you can use to increase the resolution and enhance your image. This workflow uses the upscalers: x1_ITF_SkinDiffDetail_Lite_v1, 4x_NMKD-Siax_200k, 4x-UltraSharp. I did not combine the two because the original workflow is designed for speed and simplicity. The workflow named "simple-styles-workflow-with-upscaling" will generate the image, then upscale in one process. 

Upscale models can be found here:

4x_NMKD-Siax_200k https://huggingface.co/gemasai/4x_NMKD-Siax_200k/tree/main

4x-UltraSharp https://mega.nz/folder/qZRBmaIY#nIG8KyWFcGNTuMX_XNbJ_g (Source: https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database#Universal_Models)

Alternatively, you could use StabilityAI's version, here: https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler but you'll need to clone the repo using the specified directions, as you cannot download the it normally.

Also, attached is the web extension "linkRenderNode.js" (Credit to aphaits), which enables straight lines with right angles, seen below. If you do not wish to enable this feature, you can simply delete the web/extensions folder from the repo, or change the app.canvas.links_render_mode.

0 = angular line

1 = somewhat direct, but slightly curved line

2 = normal curvy line
